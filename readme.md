# Azure Data Factory Deployment Pipeline

This is a sample GitHub README file for a pipeline that builds and deploys an Azure Data Factory (ADF) using Azure Pipelines. The pipeline is divided into multiple stages for building, validating, and deploying the ADF ARM templates. It also includes a separate stage for deploying the ADF to a production environment.

## Prerequisites

Before using this pipeline, ensure that you have the following:

- Azure subscription with appropriate access and permissions.
- Azure DevOps account with a connected GitHub repository.
- Azure Pipelines configured and connected to your GitHub repository.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of the following stages:

### Stage 1: Build_Adf_Arm_Stage

This stage builds the ADF ARM templates and exports them as artifacts. It includes the following tasks:

- **NodeTool**: Installs Node.js to execute the build process.
- **Npm**: Installs npm packages required for building and validating the ADF ARM templates.
- **Validate**: Executes a custom NPM script to validate the ARM templates and perform additional checks.
- **Validate and Generate ARM template**: Executes a custom NPM script to generate the ARM templates and export them.

### Stage 2: Deploy_Adf_Arm_Stage

This stage deploys the ADF ARM templates to the development environment. It includes the following tasks:

- **Bash**: Installs PowerShell to execute PowerShell scripts.
- **DownloadPipelineArtifact**: Downloads the build artifacts (ADF ARM templates) from the previous stage.
- **AzurePowerShell**: Executes a PowerShell script to perform pre-deployment operations, such as initializing resources and executing custom logic.
- **AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment**: Deploys the ADF ARM templates to the development environment using Azure Resource Manager.
- **AzurePowerShell**: Executes a PowerShell script to perform post-deployment operations, such as cleanup or finalization tasks.

### Stage 3: Deploy_Adf_prod

This stage deploys the ADF ARM templates to the production environment. It follows a similar structure to the Deploy_Adf_Arm_Stage but includes additional tasks for deploying to the production environment.

- **Bash**: Installs PowerShell to execute PowerShell scripts.
- **DownloadPipelineArtifact**: Downloads the build artifacts (ADF ARM templates) from the previous stage.
- **AzurePowerShell**: Executes a PowerShell script to perform pre-deployment operations specific to the production environment.
- **AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment**: Deploys the ADF ARM templates to the production environment using Azure Resource Manager.
- **AzurePowerShell**: Executes a PowerShell script to perform post-deployment operations specific to the production environment.

## Usage

To use this pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Set the appropriate values for the variables specified in the pipeline. These variables include resource group names, storage account names, container names, and other deployment-specific configurations.
2. Configure the pipeline in your Azure DevOps account and connect it to your GitHub repository.
3. Customize the pipeline as needed to fit your specific requirements. You can add additional stages, modify existing tasks, or include additional steps based on your deployment needs.
4. Trigger the pipeline to initiate the build, validation, and deployment processes for your Azure Data Factory.

## Notes

- Make sure you have the necessary permissions and access to the Azure resources mentioned in the pipeline script.
- Adjust the Azure subscription and connection details based on your specific environment and requirements.
